# TIC TAC TOE GAME

This project is a further path in my Start2Impact journey.

It consists in a famous game, tic-tac-toe.

You can try it on Netlify <a href="https://tictactoe-s2i-annamiolato.netlify.app/">here</a>.

# HOW TO PLAY

You can simply click on the board and create a column or row to win!

This game is for two players, one with "X" and another with "O". It's so easy to play.

Good luck!

# ABOUT THE CODE

In this code you can see my first approach to Vue 3.

I used Tailwind CSS to fixed all the page's style (it's my first test with Tailwind). 

I also used Vite as bundle for this project.
